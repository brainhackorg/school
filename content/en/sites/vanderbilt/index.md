## Dates
This hub will be active from May 20th to June 14th.

## Location
The course is organized by a team of researchers in the [NEURDY Lab](https://www.cchanglab.net/) at Vanderbilt University spanning two departments, Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), under the supervision of Dr. Roza G. Bayrak and Dr. Catie Chang. 

## Expertise
This site has a particular expertise in extracting information about brain activity in health and disease by combining neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) and developing advanced computational methods for individual-specific data analysis. Our research focus is highly interdisciplinary and collaborative, bridging fields such as engineering, computer science, neuroscience, psychology, and medicine.

## Prerequisites
Participants will need access to a computer, internet and to register to a number of online collaborative tools, such as discord and github. The installation of the necessary software will be covered during week 1.

## Registration
