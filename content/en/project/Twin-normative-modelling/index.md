## Project definition

### Title
Normative modelling on structural neuroimaging data from the Queensland Twin IMaging (QTIM) data set to compare individualized deviations of twins from the norm.
### Background

Normative modelling is known from growth charts, where it describes height in form of an individualized z-score/percentile score of deviation from the norm.
Similarly, normative models can be used in neuroimaging to describe an individual's deviation from a the normative variation of a  brain measure, for example from cortical thickness.

## Tools

The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies:
 * Normative modelling using the [PCN toolkit](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit)
 * python packaging.
 * google collab.
 * the [brainhack cloud](https://brainhack.org/brainhack_cloud/)

### Data

The data for this project  is the [Queensland Twin IMaging (QTIM)](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004169/versions/1.0.5) dataset: a multimodal neuroimaging dataset of young adult twins and siblings (18-30 years, N = 1026), including a subsample of participants, scanned a second time to assess test-retest reliability (N = 78, test-retest interval ~ 3.5 months).

I am going to use the derivatives from FreeSurfer parcellation that can be downloaded from the repository:
* cortical thickness data (mm)
* cortical surface area data (mm^2)
* subcortical volumes data (mm^3) 


### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - A first run  of the PNC toolkit on the twin data.
 - A package to structure the data to be able to load them into toolkit.
 - Tests that are integrated into the package to test the input data.

## Results

I was able to run the model on an initial region the data set, for males and females separately.
These are preliminary results:

### Progress overview

* the model was trained using a **2 fold cross validation** 
* the model calculates **measures of model fit**, such as:
    * explained variance
    * standardized root mean square error
    * Pearson's correlation coefficient


### Tools I learned during this project

 * **Deeper understanding of the PNC toolkit** I have now a better understanding of the Python implementation, and I customized the implementation in the Jupyter book that is included in this repository.
 * **Python packaging** I wrote my first ever Python package.
 * **Python testing** I added some tests to the package, which gave me a deeper understanding of unit tests in Python.


##### Other projects
Here are other good examples of repositories:
- [The Predictive Clinical Neuroscience toolkit](https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit) by Andre Marquand's group

## Next steps
* run the model on remaining brian regions
* look at changes of z-scores over time within individuals
* look at twin differences


## Conclusion and acknowledgement
I thank the brainhack school staff for all their support and hope to be able to join Brainhack school next year again!
