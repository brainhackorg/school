## Information

## Resources

We will watch the presentation **NiBabel: Neuroimaging data and file structures in Python** from Neurohackademy 2020 by Chris Markiewicz.

The original presentation and the practical notebook is can be found here: https://github.com/effigies/nibabel-presentations

You will need to install the example dataset with [DataLad](modules/datalad/).

```bash
mkdir ~/data
cd data
datalad install ///openneuro
cd openneuro
datalad get -r ds000114/sub-01

cd ~/data
datalad install git@github.com:OpenNeuroDerivatives/ds000228-fmriprep.git
cd ds000228-fmriprep
datalad get -r sourcedata/freesurfer/sub-pixar001/surf
datalad get sub-pixar001/anat/sub-pixar001_hemi-L_pial.surf.gii
datalad get sub-pixar001/func/sub-pixar001_task-pixar_hemi-L_space-fsaverage5_bold.func.gii
datalad get sub-pixar001/func/sub-pixar001_task-pixar_space-fsLR_den-91k_bold.dtseries.nii
```

You will need to create the environment with the 
```
pip install pipenv  # You need pipenv to create an environmnet
pipenv install Pipfile  # install the environment
pipenv run jupyter-notebook
```

Please follow the installation instrution
