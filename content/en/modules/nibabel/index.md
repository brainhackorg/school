## Information

## Resources

We will watch the presentation **NiBabel: Neuroimaging data and file structures in Python** from Neurohackademy 2020 by Chris Markiewicz.

The original presentation and the practical notebook is can be found [here](https://github.com/effigies/nibabel-presentations).
In this exercise, we will use the note book in the brainhack school repository.

### Downlad data and jupyter notebook

You will need to install the example dataset with [DataLad](modules/datalad/).

```bash
# download open neuro dataset
mkdir ~/brainhackschool_nibabel
cd ~/brainhackschool_nibabel
mkdir data
cd data
datalad install ///openneuro
cd openneuro
datalad get -r ds000114/sub-01

cd ~/brainhackschool_nibabel/data
datalad install git@github.com:OpenNeuroDerivatives/ds000228-fmriprep.git
cd ds000228-fmriprep
datalad get -r sourcedata/freesurfer/sub-pixar001/surf
datalad get -r sourcedata/freesurfer/fsaverage5

datalad get sub-pixar001/anat/sub-pixar001_hemi-L_pial.surf.gii
datalad get sub-pixar001/func/sub-pixar001_task-pixar_hemi-L_space-fsaverage5_bold.func.gii
datalad get sub-pixar001/func/sub-pixar001_task-pixar_space-fsLR_den-91k_bold.dtseries.nii

# get the surface data from midnight scan club
cd ~/brainhackschool_nibabel/data
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MidnightScanClub/MSCcodebase/master/Utilities/Conte69_atlas-v2.LR.32k_fs_LR.wb/Conte69.L.inflated.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii 

# get the tutorial
cd ~/brainhackschool_nibabel
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/tree/main/content/en/modules/nibabel/Pipfile
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/tree/main/content/en/modules/nibabel/Nibabel.py

# make a temporary directory to dump things
mkdir ~/brainhackschool_nibabel/data/tmp
```

### Set up environment

You will need to create the environment with the `Pipfile`.

```
pip install pipenv  # You need pipenv to create an environmnet
pipenv install Pipfile  # install the environment
pipenv run jupyter-notebook
```

Please follow the installation instrution
